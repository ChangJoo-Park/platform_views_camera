# example

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I recommend opening the whole workspace in VS Code by calling:

```sh
code .
```

You will see the following directories:

- `example` - our application
- `camera_view` - federated plugin
  - `camera_view` - Dart implementation of the interface and widgets
  - `camera_view_platform_interface` - a common platform interface for the `camera_view` plugin
  - `camera_view_xxx` - platform implementations of the plugin

Try it out with running the example app on your desired device (iOS, Android, or macOS).
